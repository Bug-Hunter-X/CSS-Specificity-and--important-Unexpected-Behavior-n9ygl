The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this scenario, `.parent .child` is more specific than `.child` and inherits from `.parent`, but `!important` overrides all specificity.  The seemingly simple change from `green` to `blue` in the `.parent .child` rule will not cause the text to turn blue; it will remain red due to the `!important` declaration in the `.child` rule.
