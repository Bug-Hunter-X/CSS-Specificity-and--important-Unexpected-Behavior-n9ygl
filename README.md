# CSS Specificity and !important: An Uncommon Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic issue related to CSS specificity and the `!important` declaration.  The `!important` flag, while useful in certain edge cases, can lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

The core problem lies in how `!important` interacts with inheritance and specificity.  Even if a more specific selector is applied, `!important` can override it.

## Reproduction

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a resolution.

## Solution

The recommended solution is to avoid using `!important` whenever possible.  Refactoring your CSS to leverage more specific selectors and proper nesting is often a superior and more maintainable approach.
